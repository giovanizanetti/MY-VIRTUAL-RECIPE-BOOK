# My Virtual Recipe Book

## [Check out the deployed version here!](https://virtualrecipebook.netlify.com)


## What this project is about

I am creating a cookbook using ReactJS with Redux which fetches some recipes from the Spoonacular API.
The user can save, modify, write their recipes with an image uploaded.

## My workflow

I break the main problem into smaller problems, then I go one at the time.
I maintain a backlog using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/Ybwv9R6h). 

Here are some tools and platforms which I rely upon through the development process:
  - Trello,
  - VS Code,
  - Google,
  - Docs,
  - Youtube / Udemy tutorials

## Create React App

This project was scaffolded using the create-react-app cli.

**[The standard create-react-app docs can be found in here](./create-react-app-docs.md)**
